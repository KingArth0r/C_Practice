# C-Practice
This is a collection of programs and projects to help me learn the C programming language.

## basic_*
These contain my solutions to the problems from https://www.w3resource.com/c-programming-exercises/
I do these problems do keep my familiarity with C and they are easy enough to not have to think about too many complicated things

## tic_tac_toe.c
This is a full functioning command line game of tic-tac-toe where a player can select either X or O and play with someone else.
Moves are made by writting the name of the square and you can always quit with q.
This project taught me the very basics of game logic. I was able to build this on my own and I'm quite fond of it.
I made sure to test my functions before moving on to the next feature to help keep things bug free. 
I also made loops have a condition to keep the game lasting forever. 
Also while this may be considered a bug at first, I intentionally made it to where incorrect inputs don't let you retry your turn, just to add a little bit of fun to it
